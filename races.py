#
# races.py - this builds on the MEC capability and Met Office
# to provide a summary of up coming races along with a weather forecast
#
# It does three things
#   find the events within the next 7 days (limited to met office forecast)
#   and extracts the event details - which have duty and tides for now
#   gets the met office 3 hour forecats for the period
#   constructs and sends an email - racing@ranelaghsc.co.uk
