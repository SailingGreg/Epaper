# Epaper
This is a simple app that integrates a number of feeds and displays them on Waveshae 7.5 EPD (electronic paper display). For each of the data sources there is file to explore the api so that changes can be evaluated outside of the main display. This makes development more straight forward and faster.

Note: any keys are injected by environment variables so you'll need to create your own epaper.env file and source this
